# README

## Purpose of this folder?

This project is mainly aimed at setting up configs, not installing
packages. But certain installation scripts need to be maintained
somewhere, hence this folder. 

My setup scripts will not touch this folder, so this contains all
optional install(s) that are nix-centric or probably pertain to other
package managers or binary installs. 

## Automate installation of packages or softwares?

No. Packages change name all the time, so it won't be wise to do this.
Nix recently changed vim full version's name from VimHugeX to vim-full,
for example. So it doesn't make sense to automate this stuff.
