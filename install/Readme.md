# What is this?
Code to install must-have / optional programs for different systems (Linux distros,WSL or Mac).
## What would be in here?
Programs that are not present in a minimal install.

Some programs are either out-of-date on Ubunto or not packaged right (i.e. emacs-nativecomp), so they may be added as well.
