# What is this?

Code to install must-have / optional programs for different systems (Linux
distros,WSL or Mac).

I will eventually turn some of them into specific purpose Dockerfiles.

## What would be in here?

Programs that are not present in a minimal install.

Some programs are either out-of-date on Ubuntu or not packaged right
(i.e. emacs-nativecomp), so they may be added as well.

This entire folder/sub-project is NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE. Use with
caution.
