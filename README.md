# Readme
This is my personal dotfiles, WIP.
## How to use
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/samyilin/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./setup
```
Tries to setup several configs for several programs.

If program is not installed during setup, i.e. Vim, then install Vim first, then do

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles/vim && ./setup
```
will do it.
